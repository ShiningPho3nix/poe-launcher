# Path of Exile Launcher v1.1 Release Notes

## üéØ Major Feature: Automatic Program Detection

### What's New
The biggest update yet! The launcher now automatically finds your installed programs, eliminating the need for manual path entry in most cases.

### ‚ú® Auto-Detection Features

**üîç Intelligent Detection System**
- **Registry Scanning**: Searches Windows uninstall entries for all programs
- **Multi-Drive Support**: Finds programs on C:\, D:\, E:\, or any drive

- Path of Exile Standalone & Steam versions
- Awakened PoE Trade
- PoE Lurker (including AppData installations)

**‚ö° User Experience**

- **Manual Re-scan**: "Auto-Detect Programs" button for on-demand detection
- **Smart Status**: Shows detection progress and results
- **Non-Blocking**: Runs in background, doesn't freeze the interface

### üõ† Technical Improvements

**Detection Methods**
1. **Windows Registry**: Fast detection from uninstall entries
2. **Filesystem Patterns**: Comprehensive multi-drive scanning
3. **Steam Integration**: Custom Steam library folder support
4. **Known Locations**: Handles common installation variations
